# Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning is the science of training computers to perform tasks on their own.

One way to classify machine learning:
- **supervised**
- **semi-supervised**
- **unsupervised** and,
- **reinforcement learning**.

In supervised there's classification and regression. The data used here is usually labelled.
**Classification**: the model groups new features based on what it finds common in the given features which it was trained on.
**Regression**: the model will output a numeric value based on the given features and labels it is fed during training.
Other supervised learning algorithms that I will be implementing include:
 - K Nearest Neighbors
 - Logistic regression
 - Linear regression
 - Support vector machines
 - Decision Trees and Random Forests
 - Neural networks

In Unsupervised learning, the data has no pre-defined labels and therefore these algorithms are used to uncover the patterns that would not be easily detected by human beings.
**Clustering** is one of the algorithms in this type of learning. The algorithm is fed data that has no labels and it uncovers the patterns that connects the different data and clusters the data hence the name. 
Other unsupervised algorithms that I will be implementing include:
 - Clustering: 
    * K Means
    * DBSCAN
    * HCA
 - Anomaly detection and novelty detection:
    * One-class SVM
    * Isolation Forest
 - Visualization and dimensionality reduction:
    * Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    * Kernel PCA
    * Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
    * t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding(t-SNE)
 - Association rule learning
    * Apriori
    * Eclat

Reinforcement learning is whereby the agent learns with minimal human intervention. This means that the agent observes its environment, performs a certain action based on what it  has perceived on the environment and is either rewarded or penalized based on whether its output is correct or not. 

Another way to classify machine learning:
 - **Online Learning**
 - **Batch Learning**

Batch learning: The model will be trained using all the available data. This is time-consuming and therefore it is done offline. The model is then deployed and is run the way it has already been trained without it learning anything anymore.

Online learning: The model learns incrementally in "mini-batches" and it learns as soon as the data is made available. This type of learning is great for systems that need to adapt to changes rapidly. Since the data does not need to be stored in this type of learning, it is a good option when there is a limit in resources.
In online learning, a parameter known as **learning rate** is defined as how fast or slow the system is learning. If this parameter is too high, the system tends to forget faster and if it is too slow, then the system will take a very long time to actually learn, making it less sensitive to new data and it willtake a long time to be able to make accurate predictions.

The last way to categorize machine learning learning: 
 - Model-Based learning
 - Instance-based learning
