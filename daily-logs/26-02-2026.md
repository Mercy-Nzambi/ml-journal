# MNIST-like Dataset
- This is a dataset found in the scikit library, datasets, on digits similar to the MNIST one but highly compressed and low resolution, making it easy for beginners.
- The following are the steps I have taken for the MNISTlike project.

1. Import libraries
    - I used scikit-learn and matplotlib.
    - For scikit-learn or sklearn, I imported specific functions to use.
2. Load dataset
    - Using the datasets library in sklearn, I used the digits dataset
3. Display the shape
    - This is getting to see the features and labels present in our dataset.
    - There were (1797, 64) features and (1797, ) labels
4. Create, train and predict
    - Created the model using the MLPClassifier. Why? Because it can model complex relationships in binary labels like what I am working on.
    - Split the data into testing and training data and train the model using the training subset.
    -Predict the model's output using the features in the testing subset(X_test)
5. Evaluate the prediction
    - Check the accuracy score of the model(divide the predicted labels and the actual labels) to determine the efficiency of the model.
6. Visualization
